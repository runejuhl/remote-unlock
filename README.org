* remote-unlock

Remotely unlock LUKS-encrypted disks.

Meant for use together with dropbear-initramfs which spawns an SSH server in
initramfs which can be used to unlock disks. This script reads passwords with
`pass` (password-store) from paths in the form of `hardware/disks/$UUID`.

UUIDs are automatically extraced from the crypttab, so it should be pretty
simple to set up.

It's adviced to set up SSH to use `ControlMaster auto` and `ControlPersist 2m`
to avoid having to re-open the SSH connection on evey call. Alternatively this
script could be improved to use the same SSH connection for all commands.

Tested and working on Ubuntu 18.04 (remote) and Debian 9 (local).
